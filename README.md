# SignalR - Real-time for all the things

Presentation and demo code from my SignalR presentation at DEVIntersection Las Vegas 2019

## Streaming Demo Notes

The streaming demo is **far** from complete, and not intended as "guidance" on how to do streaming. I'll work on this and get it in better shape by the end of November, 2019. 

## Icons

Thanks to [nounproject](http://thenounproject.com) for always having the icons any demo needs. 

Icons in this demo are from the [Icons Awakens collection](https://thenounproject.com/Dactrtr/collection/the-icons-awakens/) by [Dactrtr](https://thenounproject.com/Dactrtr/).
